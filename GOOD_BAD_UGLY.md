## The Good

- Go is easy to learn
- Easy concurrent programming with goroutines and channels
- Great standard library
- Go is performant
- Language defined source code format
- Standardized test framework
- Go programs are great for operations
- Defer statement, to avoid forgetting to clean up

## The Bad

- Go ignored advances in modern language design
- Interfaces are structural types
- No enumerations

## The Ugly

- Noisy error management
- Struct field tags: runtime DSL in a string
- No generics... at least not for you
- Go has few data structures beyond slice and map
